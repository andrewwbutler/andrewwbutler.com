# About

I am a postdoc in the [Bloom lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/bloom/en.html) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. I am interesting in developing and applying single-cell methods to better understand heterogeneity in the context of viral infections.

I completed my PhD with [Rahul Satija](https://satijalab.org) at New York University in 2021, where  I developed computational methods to integrate datasets, particularly in the context of single-cell genomics. I also maintain and contribute to the [Seurat R package](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/), a toolkit for single-cell genomics analysis.  

I completed my B.S. in biology at the University of Texas at Austin where I was a member of the [Dean's Scholars](https://www.cns.utexas.edu/honors/honors-programs-center/deans-scholars) honors program.
