# About

I am a PhD candidate in the Genomics and Systems Biology program at New York University where I work as a member of the [Satija Lab](https://satijalab.org). I am interested in understanding how complex patterns of gene expression and regulation manifest as diverse cellular phenotypes and how these patterns change and evolve. Towards that end, I develop computational methods to integrate datasets and enable comparative analyses, particularly in the context of single-cell genomics. I also maintain and contribute to the Seurat R package, a toolkit for single-cell genomics analysis.  

I completed by B.S. in biology at the University of Texas at Austin where I was a member of the Dean's Scholars honors program.
