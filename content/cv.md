### Education ###
-----------------
**New York University**  
Ph.D. Biology  - _August 2015-May 2021_
<br>
Advisor: Rahul Satija

**University of Texas at Austin**  
B.S. Biology Honors  - _August 2011-May 2015_
<br>


### Research Experience ###
---------------------------
**Single-cell virology** - September 2021 - Current  
*Advisor: Jesse Bloom*

  - Conducting research applying and developing single-cell genomic
    methodologies to address questions regarding heterogeneity in viral
    infections.

**Single-cell genomics** - May 2016 - August 2021  
*Advisor: Rahul Satija*

  - Conducted research on methods development for single-cell RNA-seq analsysis.
    Topics of interest included cell type identification through supervised and
    unsupervised analyses and methods for data integration. Also contributed as
    one of the lead developers to Seurat, the open source R package developed
    and maintained by the Satija lab.

**Computational Biology** - Summer 2013 - Spring 2015  
*Advisor: Claus Wilke*

  - Conducted research focused on improving multiple protein sequence alignment.
    Hidden markov models were used as the basis of these alignment algorithms in
    order to incorporate relevant biochemical/biophysical information into the
    alignments. Also contributed to a collaborative project aiming to better
    characterize bacterial metabolism. Worked primarily with RNA-Seq data to
    understand tRNA gene levels

**Virtual Drug Screening - Freshman Research Initiative** - Summer 2012 - Spring 2013  
*Advisor: Josh Beckham*

  - Conducted preliminary drug discovery research. A combination of wet lab
    techniques and virtual high throughput screening methods were used in an
    attempt to find inhibitors for a protein target of interest. Worked
    primarily on a protein critical to viability in *Plasmodium falciparum*.
